# GPU-image-filtering

This repository contains three different filters for image processing (LP filter, gaussian and a median filter). 

This code was developed for the course TDDD56 (Multicore and GPU-programming) at Linköpings universitet.

The computer that run this code will need to use a NVIDIA graphics card.
